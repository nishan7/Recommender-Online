### Live Website
https://recsys-app.herokuapp.com/

It is based on my previous project IMDb-Recommender https://github.com/nishan7/IMDb-Recommender.

It is the python/flask website used to recommend movies based on other movie
 your like.

It is based on the movieLens dataset. https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

It uses cosine similarity between movies to find similarity between the movies.

Then based on user's personal movies choice and cosine similarity of those movies, it generates the recommendations.

Python flask is used to create the interface.

TMDb Database is used to obtain the poster images.
