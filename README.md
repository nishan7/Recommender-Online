- It is based on my previous project IMDb-Recommender https://github.com/nishan7/IMDb-Recommender.

- It is the python/flask website used to recommend movies based on other movie
 your like.

- Created REST API to get the recommended movies using TMDb IDs

- It is based on the movieLens dataset. https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

- It uses cosine similarity between movies to find similarity between the movies.

- Then based on user's personal movies choice and cosine similarity of those movies, it generates the recommendations.

- Python flask is used to create the interface.

- TMDb Database is used to obtain the poster images.
